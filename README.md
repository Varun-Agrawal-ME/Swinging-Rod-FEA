# Swinging-Rod-FEA
The MATLAB codes were generated to determine the displacement and strain field for linear element solution with 4 and 20 elements, 
quadratic element solution with 4 and 8 elements, and cubic element solution with 1 and 4 elements. For the linear and quadratic
elements, the rate of convergence of displacement and energy error norm was computed. Finally, a comparison was made for displacement
and strain fields between MATLAB outputs, analytical solutions, and the approximate solution from FEA.
All the codes are in the report.
